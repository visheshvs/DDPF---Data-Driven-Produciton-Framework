# Data-Driven Production Framework (DDPF)

This repository contains the code and data implementation of the Data-Driven Production Framework (DDPF) developed as part of Ph.D. research by Vishesh Vikram Singh at UC Berkeley under the supervision of Prof. Iris D. Tommelein.

## Coming Soon!

The code and data from the research will be made available here soon. This includes:

- Implementation of Work Density Method (WDM)
- ViWoLZo tool for visual workload leveling and zoning
- Data models and schemas for production planning and control
- ML models for work density prediction
- Production performance dashboard
- Data collection and analysis tools

## About the Research

This research addresses challenges in adopting location-based production planning and control methods in construction by developing a comprehensive Data-Driven Production Framework (DDPF). The framework integrates planning and control components using work density to measure, store, and utilize actual production data.

Key contributions include:
- Novel work density-based approach for production planning
- Data-driven methods for production control
- Machine learning models for workload prediction
- Integration of cost modeling with production planning
